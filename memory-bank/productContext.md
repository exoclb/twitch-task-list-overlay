# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Twitch Task List Overlay addresses a common need in the streaming community: **interactive task management during live streams**. Many streamers, especially those focused on productivity, coding, studying, or project work, benefit from having a visible task list that viewers can engage with.

## Problems It Solves

### For Streamers:
- **Engagement Gap**: Traditional task lists are static and don't involve viewers
- **Organization Challenge**: Managing tasks while streaming can be distracting
- **Content Structure**: Provides clear goals and progress tracking for stream content
- **Viewer Interaction**: Creates meaningful ways for viewers to participate in the stream

### For Viewers:
- **Passive Viewing**: Transforms viewers from passive observers to active participants
- **Community Building**: Allows viewers to contribute to the streamer's goals
- **Learning Opportunity**: Viewers can suggest tasks and learn from the process

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience:
1. **Seamless Integration**: The overlay appears naturally on the stream without being intrusive
2. **Intuitive Commands**: Simple chat commands that anyone can learn quickly
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual response when tasks are added, edited, or completed
4. **Personal Ownership**: Each viewer maintains their own task list, creating personal investment

### Interaction Flow:
```
Viewer types !task "Learn JavaScript" 
→ Task appears on overlay instantly
→ Streamer can see and discuss the task
→ Viewer can edit, complete, or delete their tasks
→ Community sees progress and can engage
```
