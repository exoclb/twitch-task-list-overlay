# Progress

## What Works

### Core Functionality âœ…
- **Task Management System**: Complete CRUD operations for user tasks
  - Add tasks with `!task` or `!add` commands
  - Edit tasks with `!edit [#] [new text]`
  - Mark tasks complete with `!done [#]`
  - Delete tasks with `!delete [#]`
  - Focus on tasks with `!focus [#]`
  - Check task status with `!check`

- **User-Specific Storage**: Each viewer maintains their own task list
  - Tasks persist across stream sessions
  - No conflicts between different users
  - Automatic backup every 30 seconds

- **Real-Time UI Updates**: Immediate visual feedback
  - Tasks appear instantly when added
  - Smooth animations for state changes
  - Dynamic task counters and progress tracking

### StreamElements Integration âœ…
- **Event Handling**: Responds to chat messages through SE event system
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses SE_API for reliable data persistence
- **Configuration System**: Fully customizable through fields.json
- **Widget Deployment**: Ready for StreamElements custom widget setup

### Command System âœ…
- **Flexible Commands**: Multiple aliases for user convenience
- **Permission System**: Moderator-only commands for content management
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for invalid commands
- **Help System**: On-screen help display with `!help` command

### Visual Design âœ…
- **Customizable Theming**: Colors, opacity, and styling options
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different content amounts
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS-based transitions and effects
- **Typography**: Clean Roboto Mono font with fallbacks

### Moderator Tools âœ…
- **Content Management**: Clear all tasks, completed tasks, or specific user tasks
- **Permission Checking**: Validates broadcaster/moderator/VIP status
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient management of large task lists

## What's Left to Build

### Current Status: **COMPLETE** ðŸŽ‰
The Twitch Task List Overlay is a fully functional, production-ready widget with all planned features implemented.

### Potential Future Enhancements (Optional):
1. **Additional Language Support**: Expand beyond current 7 languages
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Task completion statistics and trends
3. **Custom Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for task actions
4. **Task Categories**: Organize tasks by type or priority
5. **Time Tracking**: Track time spent on focused tasks
6. **Export Functionality**: Save task lists to external formats
7. **Integration APIs**: Connect with other productivity tools

## Current Status

### Project State: **PRODUCTION READY** âœ…
- All core features implemented and tested
- Complete documentation in Memory Bank
- Ready for deployment to StreamElements
- Suitable for immediate use by streamers

### Performance Status: **OPTIMIZED** âœ…
- Lightweight JavaScript implementation
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Minimal memory footprint
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Compatibility Status: **VERIFIED** âœ…
- Works with StreamElements platform
- Compatible with OBS Browser Source
- Supports modern browsers (ES6+)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Known Issues

### Current Issues: **NONE** âœ…
No known bugs or critical issues at this time.

### Potential Considerations:
1. **Storage Limits**: StreamElements storage has undocumented limits
2. **Chat Rate Limits**: High-volume chat might cause delays
3. **Browser Memory**: Long streams with many tasks could use more memory
4. **Mobile Compatibility**: Not optimized for mobile viewing (by design)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions:
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Chosen due to StreamElements constraints
- **User-Centric Storage**: Each user gets their own task list
- **Command-Based Interface**: Chat commands for all interactions
- **Real-Time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback essential

### Refinements Made:
- **Help System**: Added on-screen help display for better UX
- **Animation System**: CSS animations for smooth user experience
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when storage fails
- **Customization Options**: Extensive theming through configuration

### Architecture Evolution:
- **Event-Driven Design**: Responds to StreamElements events
- **State Management**: Global state with persistent storage
- **Modular Functions**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient DOM updates and memory usage

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics: **ACHIEVED** âœ…
- **Zero Critical Bugs**: No blocking issues identified
- **Performance**: Lightweight and responsive
- **Compatibility**: Works across target platforms
- **Maintainability**: Clean, documented code
