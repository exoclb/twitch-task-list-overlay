# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Status**: Memory Bank initialization complete - all core files created and populated with comprehensive project documentation.

**Recent Changes**:
- Created complete Memory Bank structure with all 6 core files
- Documented project overview, product context, system architecture, and technical details
- Analyzed all project files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, configuration)
- Established foundation for future development work

## Next Steps

1. **Create `progress.md`** - Document current project status and what's working
2. **Verify Memory Bank completeness** - Ensure all documentation is accurate and comprehensive
3. **Ready for development tasks** - Memory Bank now provides complete context for any future work

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Strategy:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of the project documented from multiple angles
- **Technical Depth**: Detailed system patterns and implementation details captured
- **User-Centric Focus**: Product context emphasizes user experience and engagement goals

### Project Understanding:
- **Core Functionality**: Interactive task management overlay for Twitch streamers
- **Technology Stack**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 with StreamElements integration
- **Target Audience**: Productivity streamers, coding streamers, study streamers

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Patterns:
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Responds to StreamElements chat events
- **User-Centric Storage**: Each viewer maintains personal task list
- **Command Pattern**: Flexible command aliases and parsing
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Continues operation despite storage failures

### Development Preferences:
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No external libraries due to StreamElements constraints
- **Performance-First**: Lightweight implementation for streaming environments
- **Customizable Design**: Extensive theming options through configuration
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual feedback and intuitive commands

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights:
1. **StreamElements Integration**: Project is tightly coupled with StreamElements platform
2. **Real-Time Requirements**: Immediate UI updates essential for viewer engagement
3. **Permission System**: Moderator commands provide content management capabilities
4. **Persistent Storage**: Tasks survive stream sessions through SE_API storage

### Technical Insights:
1. **Storage Strategy**: User-specific storage keys prevent data conflicts
2. **UI Performance**: CSS animations preferred over JavaScript for smooth experience
3. **Command Flexibility**: Multiple aliases and formats improve user experience
4. **Error Recovery**: In-memory state provides fallback when storage fails

### User Experience Insights:
1. **Engagement Model**: Transforms passive viewers into active participants
2. **Personal Ownership**: Individual task lists create investment in stream content
3. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to commands maintains engagement
4. **Help System**: On-screen help reduces learning curve for new users

## Current Project State

### What's Working:
- Complete widget implementation with all core features
